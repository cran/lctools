\title{Spatial Interaction Models: gw / regional variable}
\description{Regional variables are meant to capture the possible pull effects on internal out-migration caused by conditions elsewhere in the country (Fotheringham et al., 2002; 2004). For example (see code below), the regional variable of the total population is calculated as an index that compares the total population in a zone with the total population of the surrounding zones weighted by a second power of distance. It is used to capture a pull effect produced when an origin is surrounded by very populous zones that draw migrants from the origin (Kalogirou, 2013). Nearby locations are weighted more heavily in the calculation than more distant ones, adopting the idea of the Tobler's first law of Geography. Thus, this variable could be referred to as gw (geographically weighted) variable.
