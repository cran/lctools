\title{Moran's I classic statistic for assessing spatial autocorrelation using a ready made weights matrix.}
\description{Moran's I is one of the oldest statistics used to examine spatial autocorrelation. This global statistic was first proposed by Moran (1948, 1950). Later, Cliff and Ord (1973, 1981) present a comprehensive work on spatial autocorrelation and suggested a formula to calculate the I which is now used in most textbooks and software: \deqn{I = (n/W)*(\Sigma \Sigma w_{ij}*z_i*z_j/ \Sigma z_i^2)} where n is number of observations, W is the sum of the weights w_ij for all pairs in the system, z_i=x_i - mean(x) where x is the value of the variable at location i and mean(x) the mean value of the variable in question (Eq. 5.2 Kalogirou, 2003).

The implementation here allows for the use of a weights matrix that could use any weighting scheme created either within lctools (using the w.matrix function) or other R packages. Resampling and randomization null hypotheses have been tested following the discussion of Goodchild (1986, pp. 24-26).

\usage{
moransI.w(x, w)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric vector of a variable}
  \item{w}{Weights Matrix usin w.matrix or other R function}
}
\details{The Moran's I statistic ranges from -1 to 1. Values in the interval (-1, 0) indicate negative spatial autocorrelation (low values tend to have neighbours with high values and vice versa), values near 0 indicate no spatial autocorrelation (no spatial pattern - random spatial distribution) and values in the interval (0,1) indicate positive spatial autocorrelation (spatial clusters of similarly low or high values between neighbour municipalities should be expected.)
}
\value{Returns the calculated Moran's I and a list of statistics for the latter's inference: the expected I (E[I]), z scores and p values for both resampling and randomization null hypotheses.
  \item{Morans.I}{Classic global Moran's I statistic}

  \item{z.randomization}{The z score calculated for the randomization null hypotheses test}
